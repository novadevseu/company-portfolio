        Once you join, you and your crew get an invite to our Breeew kanban board, where you can team up with minimal in real-time. From here, you can chat directly with minimal, shooting over as many design requests as you fancy.

        I'll tackle each request step by step, and feel free to ask for as many tweaks as you need.
